# Template Development

To create [pagestudio] templates you will need to create a [developer account](http://). If you do not have an account, or have not yet created one, follow the [create an account](http://) guide first. You will also need a development server configured to work with your account. We've provided a Vagrant development server for you to make the development process easier. Instructions can be found on the [installation] page.
