# Plugins

Plugins are the simplest type of add-on in PageStudio, but they are at the core of how you access functionality via **tags**.

For an example, let's take the user plugin, which is a part of the user module. 


```eval_rst
.. note:: 

    Modules can have a plugin as a part of the module, see the module overview for more info on that.

```

Each plugin has a name (or slug) by which we reference it in the tags. For example, if we wanted to get the username of the current user, we would use:

```	
{{ user:username }}
```

We can also specify a user id and get the username of a specific user:

```
{{ user:username user_id="5" }}
```

Whenever you are using tags in PageStudio, you are interfacing with a plugin.

## Template Tag Logic

To get a full idea of what tags can do, make sure you read over the PageStudio tag system documentation.

## Installing Plugins

Plugins have no installation procedure. Just upload them to application/plugins/ and use the tag in your template layouts/partials!

## Core Plugins

```eval_rst
    .. toctree::
        :titlesonly:
        :maxdepth: 1
    
        helper/index
        secure/index
        template/index
